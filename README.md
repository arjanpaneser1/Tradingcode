Trading Projects by Arjan Singh Paneser

Welcome to my portfolio of trading, finance, and data-driven Python projects. As a medical sciences student at UCL with a passion for markets, I've developed these projects to demonstrate my practical skills in financial modeling, backtesting strategies, risk simulation, and machine learning.
